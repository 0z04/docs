# This workflow will build and push a new container image to Alibaba Cloud Container Registry (ACR),
# and then will deploy it to Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK), when there is a push to the master branch.
#
# To use this workflow, you will need to complete the following set-up steps:
#
# 1. Create an ACR repository to store your container images. 
#    You can use ACR EE instance for more security and better performance.
#    For instructions see https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/142168.htm
#
# 2. Create an ACK cluster to run your containerized application.
#    You can use ACK Pro cluster for more security and better performance.
#    For instructions see https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/95108.htm
#
# 3. Store your AccessKey pair in GitHub Actions secrets named `ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `ACCESS_KEY_SECRET`.
#    For instructions on setting up secrets see: https://developer.github.com/actions/managing-workflows/storing-secrets/
#
# 4. Change the values for the REGION_ID, REGISTRY, NAMESPACE, IMAGE, ACK_CLUSTER_ID, and ACK_DEPLOYMENT_NAME.

# üíÅ The OpenShift Starter workflow will:
# - Checkout your repository
# - Perform a container image build
# - Push the built image to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
# - Log in to your OpenShift cluster
# - Create an OpenShift app from the image and expose it to the internet

# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Configure your repository and the workflow with the following steps:
# 1. Have access to an OpenShift cluster. Refer to https://www.openshift.com/try
# 2. Create the OPENSHIFT_SERVER and OPENSHIFT_TOKEN repository secrets. Refer to:
#   - https://github.com/redhat-actions/oc-login#readme
#   - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets
#   - https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_secret_set
# 3. (Optional) Edit the top-level 'env' section as marked with 'üñäÔ∏è' if the defaults are not suitable for your project.
# 4. (Optional) Edit the build-image step to build your project.
#    The default build type is by using a Dockerfile at the root of the repository,
#    but can be replaced with a different file, a source-to-image build, or a step-by-step buildah build.
# 5. Commit and push the workflow file to your default branch to trigger a workflow run.

# This workflow installs the latest version of Terraform CLI and configures the Terraform CLI configuration file
# with an API token for Terraform Cloud (app.terraform.io). On pull request events, this workflow will run
# `terraform init`, `terraform fmt`, and `terraform plan` (speculative plan via Terraform Cloud). On push events
# to the master branch, `terraform apply` will be executed.
#
# Documentation for `hashicorp/setup-terraform` is located here: https://github.com/hashicorp/setup-terraform
#
# To use this workflow, you will need to complete the following setup steps.
#
# 1. Create a `main.tf` file in the root of this repository with the `remote` backend and one or more resources defined.
#   Example `main.tf`:
#     # The configuration for the `remote` backend.
#     terraform {
#       backend "remote" {
#         # The name of your Terraform Cloud organization.
#         organization = "example-organization"
#
#         # The name of the Terraform Cloud workspace to store Terraform state files in.
#         workspaces {
#           name = "example-workspace"
#         }
#       }
#     }
#
#     # An example resource that does nothing.
#     resource "null_resource" "example" {
#       triggers = {
#         value = "A example resource that does nothing!"
#       }
#     }
#
#
# 2. Generate a Terraform Cloud user API token and store it as a GitHub secret (e.g. TF_API_TOKEN) on this repository.
#   Documentation:
#     - https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens.html
#     - https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets
#
# 3. Reference the GitHub secret in step using the `hashicorp/setup-terraform` GitHub Action.
#   Example:
#     - name: Setup Terraform
#       uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1
#       with:
#         cli_config_credentials_token: ${{ secrets.TF_API_TOKEN }}

# üíÅ The OpenShift Starter workflow will:
# - Checkout your repository
# - Perform a container image build
# - Push the built image to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
# - Log in to your OpenShift cluster
# - Create an OpenShift app from the image and expose it to the internet

# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Configure your repository and the workflow with the following steps:
# 1. Have access to an OpenShift cluster. Refer to https://www.openshift.com/try
# 2. Create the OPENSHIFT_SERVER and OPENSHIFT_TOKEN repository secrets. Refer to:
#   - https://github.com/redhat-actions/oc-login#readme
#   - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets
#   - https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_secret_set
# 3. (Optional) Edit the top-level 'env' section as marked with 'üñäÔ∏è' if the defaults are not suitable for your project.
# 4. (Optional) Edit the build-image step to build your project.
#    The default build type is by using a Dockerfile at the root of the repository,
#    but can be replaced with a different file, a source-to-image build, or a step-by-step buildah build.
# 5. Commit and push the workflow file to your default branch to trigger a workflow run.

# This workflow installs the latest version of Terraform CLI and configures the Terraform CLI configuration file
# with an API token for Terraform Cloud (app.terraform.io). On pull request events, this workflow will run
# `terraform init`, `terraform fmt`, and `terraform plan` (speculative plan via Terraform Cloud). On push events
# to the master branch, `terraform apply` will be executed.
#
# Documentation for `hashicorp/setup-terraform` is located here: https://github.com/hashicorp/setup-terraform
#
# To use this workflow, you will need to complete the following setup steps.
#
# 1. Create a `main.tf` file in the root of this repository with the `remote` backend and one or more resources defined.
#   Example `main.tf`:
#     # The configuration for the `remote` backend.
#     terraform {
#       backend "remote" {
#         # The name of your Terraform Cloud organization.
#         organization = "example-organization"
#
#         # The name of the Terraform Cloud workspace to store Terraform state files in.
#         workspaces {
#           name = "example-workspace"
#         }
#       }
#     }
#
#     # An example resource that does nothing.
#     resource "null_resource" "example" {
#       triggers = {
#         value = "A example resource that does nothing!"
#       }
#     }
#
#
# 2. Generate a Terraform Cloud user API token and store it as a GitHub secret (e.g. TF_API_TOKEN) on this repository.
#   Documentation:
#     - https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens.html
#     - https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets
#
# 3. Reference the GitHub secret in step using the `hashicorp/setup-terraform` GitHub Action.
#   Example:
#     - name: Setup Terraform
#       uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1
#       with:
#         cli_config_credentials_token: ${{ secrets.TF_API_TOKEN }}

# üíÅ The OpenShift Starter workflow will:
# - Checkout your repository
# - Perform a container image build
# - Push the built image to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
# - Log in to your OpenShift cluster
# - Create an OpenShift app from the image and expose it to the internet

# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Configure your repository and the workflow with the following steps:
# 1. Have access to an OpenShift cluster. Refer to https://www.openshift.com/try
# 2. Create the OPENSHIFT_SERVER and OPENSHIFT_TOKEN repository secrets. Refer to:
#   - https://github.com/redhat-actions/oc-login#readme
#   - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets
#   - https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_secret_set
# 3. (Optional) Edit the top-level 'env' section as marked with 'üñäÔ∏è' if the defaults are not suitable for your project.
# 4. (Optional) Edit the build-image step to build your project.
#    The default build type is by using a Dockerfile at the root of the repository,
#    but can be replaced with a different file, a source-to-image build, or a step-by-step buildah build.
# 5. Commit and push the workflow file to your default branch to trigger a workflow run.

# This workflow installs the latest version of Terraform CLI and configures the Terraform CLI configuration file
# with an API token for Terraform Cloud (app.terraform.io). On pull request events, this workflow will run
# `terraform init`, `terraform fmt`, and `terraform plan` (speculative plan via Terraform Cloud). On push events
# to the master branch, `terraform apply` will be executed.
#
# Documentation for `hashicorp/setup-terraform` is located here: https://github.com/hashicorp/setup-terraform
#
# To use this workflow, you will need to complete the following setup steps.
#
# 1. Create a `main.tf` file in the root of this repository with the `remote` backend and one or more resources defined.
#   Example `main.tf`:
#     # The configuration for the `remote` backend.
#     terraform {
#       backend "remote" {
#         # The name of your Terraform Cloud organization.
#         organization = "example-organization"
#
#         # The name of the Terraform Cloud workspace to store Terraform state files in.
#         workspaces {
#           name = "example-workspace"
#         }
#       }
#     }
#
#     # An example resource that does nothing.
#     resource "null_resource" "example" {
#       triggers = {
#         value = "A example resource that does nothing!"
#       }
#     }
#
#
# 2. Generate a Terraform Cloud user API token and store it as a GitHub secret (e.g. TF_API_TOKEN) on this repository.
#   Documentation:
#     - https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens.html
#     - https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets
#
# 3. Reference the GitHub secret in step using the `hashicorp/setup-terraform` GitHub Action.
#   Example:
#     - name: Setup Terraform
#       uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1

# üíÅ The OpenShift Starter workflow will:
# - Checkout your repository
# - Perform a container image build
# - Push the built image to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
# - Log in to your OpenShift cluster
# - Create an OpenShift app from the image and expose it to the internet

# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Configure your repository and the workflow with the following steps:
# 1. Have access to an OpenShift cluster. Refer to https://www.openshift.com/try
# 2. Create the OPENSHIFT_SERVER and OPENSHIFT_TOKEN repository secrets. Refer to:
#   - https://github.com/redhat-actions/oc-login#readme
#   - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets
#   - https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_secret_set
# 3. (Optional) Edit the top-level 'env' section as marked with 'üñäÔ∏è' if the defaults are not suitable for your project.
# 4. (Optional) Edit the build-image step to build your project.
#    The default build type is by using a Dockerfile at the root of the repository,
#    but can be replaced with a different file, a source-to-image build, or a step-by-step buildah build.
# 5. Commit and push the workflow file to your default branch to trigger a workflow run.

# This workflow installs the latest version of Terraform CLI and configures the Terraform CLI configuration file
# with an API token for Terraform Cloud (app.terraform.io). On pull request events, this workflow will run
# `terraform init`, `terraform fmt`, and `terraform plan` (speculative plan via Terraform Cloud). On push events
# to the master branch, `terraform apply` will be executed.
#
# Documentation for `hashicorp/setup-terraform` is located here: https://github.com/hashicorp/setup-terraform
#
# To use this workflow, you will need to complete the following setup steps.
#
# 1. Create a `main.tf` file in the root of this repository with the `remote` backend and one or more resources defined.
#   Example `main.tf`:
#     # The configuration for the `remote` backend.
#     terraform {
#       backend "remote" {
#         # The name of your Terraform Cloud organization.
#         organization = "example-organization"
#
#         # The name of the Terraform Cloud workspace to store Terraform state files in.
#         workspaces {
#           name = "example-workspace"
#         }
#       }
#     }
#
#     # An example resource that does nothing.
#     resource "null_resource" "example" {
#       triggers = {
#         value = "A example resource that does nothing!"
#       }
#     }
#
#
# 2. Generate a Terraform Cloud user API token and store it as a GitHub secret (e.g. TF_API_TOKEN) on this repository.
#   Documentation:
#     - https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens.html

## Configuring workflow events

You can configure workflows to run for one or more events using the `on` workflow syntax. For more information, see "[Workflow syntax for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}](/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on)."

{% data reusables.github-actions.actions-on-examples %}

{% note %}

**Note:** You cannot trigger new workflow runs using the `GITHUB_TOKEN`. For more information, see "[Triggering new workflows using a personal access token](#triggering-new-workflows-using-a-personal-access-token)."

{% endnote %}

The following steps occur to trigger a workflow run:

1. An event occurs on your repository, and the resulting event has an associated commit SHA and Git ref.
2. The `.github/workflows` directory in your repository is searched for workflow files at the associated commit SHA or Git ref. The workflow files must be present in that commit SHA or Git ref to be considered.

  For example, if the event occurred on a particular repository branch, then the workflow files must be present in the repository on that branch.
1. The workflow files for that commit SHA and Git ref are inspected, and a new workflow run is triggered for any workflows that have `on:` values that match the triggering event.

  The workflow runs on your repository's code at the same commit SHA and Git ref that triggered the event. When a workflow runs, {% data variables.product.product_name %} sets the `GITHUB_SHA` (commit SHA) and `GITHUB_REF` (Git ref) environment variables in the runner environment. For more information, see "[Using environment variables](/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/using-environment-variables)."

## Scheduled events

The `schedule` event allows you to trigger a workflow at a scheduled time.

{% data reusables.actions.schedule-delay %}

### `schedule`

| Webhook event payload | Activity types | `GITHUB_SHA` | `GITHUB_REF` |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------|
| n/a | n/a | Last commit on default branch | Default branch | When the scheduled workflow is set to run. A scheduled workflow uses [POSIX cron syntax](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/crontab.html#tag_20_25_07). For more information, see "[Triggering a workflow with events](/articles/configuring-a-workflow/#triggering-a-workflow-with-events)." |

{% data reusables.repositories.actions-scheduled-workflow-example %}

Cron syntax has five fields separated by a space, and each field represents a unit of time.

```
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ minute (0 - 59)
‚îÇ ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ hour (0 - 23)
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ day of the month (1 - 31)
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ month (1 - 12 or JAN-DEC)
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ day of the week (0 - 6 or SUN-SAT)
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ
* * * * *
```

You can use these operators in any of the five fields:

| Operator | Description | Example |
| -------- | ----------- | ------- |
| * | Any value | `* * * * *` runs every minute of every day. |
| , | Value list separator | `2,10 4,5 * * *` runs at minute 2 and 10 of the 4th and 5th hour of every day. |
| - | Range of values | `0 4-6 * * *` runs at minute 0 of the 4th, 5th, and 6th hour. |
| / | Step values | `20/15 * * * *` runs every 15 minutes starting from minute 20 through 59 (minutes 20, 35, and 50). |

{% note %}

**Note:** {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} does not support the non-standard syntax `@yearly`, `@monthly`, `@weekly`, `@daily`, `@hourly`, and `@reboot`.

{% endnote %}

You can use [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru/) to help generate your cron syntax and confirm what time it will run. To help you get started, there is also a list of [crontab guru examples](https://crontab.guru/examples.html).

Notifications for scheduled workflows are sent to the user who last modified the cron syntax in the workflow file. For more information, please see "[Notifications for workflow runs](/actions/guides/about-continuous-integration#notifications-for-workflow-runs)."

## Manual events

You can manually trigger workflow runs. To trigger specific workflows in a repository, use the `workflow_dispatch` event. To trigger more than one workflow in a repository and create custom events and event types, use the `repository_dispatch` event.

### `workflow_dispatch`

| Webhook event payload | Activity types | `GITHUB_SHA` | `GITHUB_REF` |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------------|
| [workflow_dispatch](/webhooks/event-payloads/#workflow_dispatch) | n/a | Last commit on the `GITHUB_REF` branch | Branch that received dispatch |

You can configure custom-defined input properties, default input values, and required inputs for the event directly in your workflow. When the workflow runs, you can access the input values in the `github.event.inputs` context. For more information, see "[Contexts](/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts)."

You can manually trigger a workflow run using the {% ifversion fpt or ghec %}{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}{% else %}{% data variables.product.product_name %}{% endif %} API and from {% data variables.product.product_name %}. For more information, see "[Manually running a workflow](/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow)."

 When you trigger the event on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, you can provide the `ref` and any `inputs` directly on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. For more information, see "[Using inputs and outputs with an action](/actions/learn-github-actions/finding-and-customizing-actions#using-inputs-and-outputs-with-an-action)."

 To trigger the custom `workflow_dispatch` webhook event using the REST API, you must send a `POST` request to a {% ifversion fpt or ghec %}{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}{% else %}{% data variables.product.product_name %}{% endif %} API endpoint and provide the `ref` and any required `inputs`. For more information, see the "[Create a workflow dispatch event](/rest/reference/actions/#create-a-workflow-dispatch-event)" REST API endpoint.

#### Example

To use the `workflow_dispatch` event, you need to include it as a trigger in your GitHub Actions workflow file. The example below only runs the workflow when it's manually triggered:

```yaml
on: workflow_dispatch
```

#### Example workflow configuration

This example defines the `name` and `home` inputs and prints them using the `github.event.inputs.name` and `github.event.inputs.home` contexts. If a `home` isn't provided, the default value 'The Octoverse' is printed.

{% raw %}
```yaml
name: Manually triggered workflow
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      name:
        description: 'Person to greet'
        required: true
        default: 'Mona the Octocat'
      home:
        description: 'location'
        required: false
        default: 'The Octoverse'

jobs:
  say_hello:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: |
          echo "Hello ${{ github.event.inputs.name }}!"
          echo "- in ${{ github.event.inputs.home }}!"
```
{% endraw %}

### `repository_dispatch`

| Webhook event payload | Activity types | `GITHUB_SHA` | `GITHUB_REF` |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------------|
| [repository_dispatch](/webhooks/event-payloads/#repository_dispatch) | n/a | Last commit on default branch | Default branch |

{% data reusables.github-actions.branch-requirement %}

You can use the {% ifversion fpt or ghec %}{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}{% else %}{% data variables.product.product_name %}{% endif %} API to trigger a webhook event called [`repository_dispatch`](/webhooks/event-payloads/#repository_dispatch) when you want to trigger a workflow for activity that happens outside of {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. For more information, see "[Create a repository dispatch event](/rest/reference/repos#create-a-repository-dispatch-event)."

To trigger the custom `repository_dispatch` webhook event, you must send a `POST` request to a {% ifversion fpt or ghec %}{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}{% else %}{% data variables.product.product_name %}{% endif %} API endpoint and provide an `event_type` name to describe the activity type. To trigger a workflow run, you must also configure your workflow to use the `repository_dispatch` event.

#### Example

By default, all `event_types` trigger a workflow to run. You can limit your workflow to run when a specific `event_type` value is sent in the `repository_dispatch` webhook payload. You define the event types sent in the `repository_dispatch` payload when you create the repository dispatch event.

```yaml
on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [opened, deleted]
```

{% ifversion fpt or ghes > 3.3 or ghae-issue-4757 or ghec %}
## Workflow reuse events

`workflow_call` is a keyword used as the value of `on` in a workflow, in the same way as an event. It indicates that a workflow can be called from another workflow. For more information see, "[Reusing workflows](/actions/learn-github-actions/reusing-workflows)."

### `workflow_call`

| Webhook event payload | Activity types | `GITHUB_SHA` | `GITHUB_REF` |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------------|
| Same as the caller workflow | n/a | Same as the caller workflow | Same as the caller workflow |

#### Example

To make a workflow reusable it must include `workflow_call` as one of the values of `on`. The example below only runs the workflow when it's called from another workflow:

```yaml
on: workflow_call
```
{% endif %}

## Webhook events

You can configure your workflow to run when webhook events are generated on {% data variables.product.product_name %}. Some events have more than one activity type that triggers the event. If more than one activity type triggers the event, you can specify which activity types will trigger the workflow to run. For more information, see "[Webhooks](/webhooks)."

Not all webhook events trigger workflows. For the complete list of available webhook events and their payloads, see "[Webhook events and payloads](/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhook-events-and-payloads)."

{% ifversion fpt or ghec or ghes > 3.3 or ghae-issue-4968  %}
### `branch_protection_rule`

Runs your workflow anytime the `branch_protection_rule` event occurs. {% data reusables.developer-site.multiple_activity_types %} For information about the GraphQL API, see "[BranchProtectionRule]({% ifversion ghec %}/free-pro-team@latest{% endif %}/graphql/reference/objects#branchprotectionrule)."

{% data reusables.github-actions.branch-requirement %}

| Webhook event payload | Activity types | `GITHUB_SHA` | `GITHUB_REF` |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------|
| [`branch_protection_rule`](/webhooks/event-payloads/#branch_protection_rule) | - `created`<br/>- `edited`<br/>- `deleted` | Last commit on default branch | Default branch |

{% data reusables.developer-site.limit_workflow_to_activity_types %}

For example, you can run a workflow when a branch protection rule has been `created` or `deleted`.

```yaml
on:
  branch_protection_rule:
    types: [created, deleted]
```
{% endif %}

### `check_run`

Runs your workflow anytime the `check_run` event occurs. {% data reusables.developer-site.multiple_activity_types %} For information about the REST API, see "[Check runs](/rest/reference/checks#runs)."

{% data reusables.github-actions.branch-requirement %}

| Webhook event payload | Activity types | `GITHUB_SHA` | `GITHUB_REF` |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------|
| [`check_run`](/webhooks/event-payloads/#check_run) | - `created`<br/>- `rerequested`<br/>- `completed` | Last commit on default branch | Default branch |

{% data reusables.developer-site.limit_workflow_to_activity_types %}

For example, you can run a workflow when a check run has been `rerequested` or `completed`.

```yaml
on:
  check_run:
    types: [rerequested, completed]
```

### `check_suite`

Runs your workflow anytime the `check_suite` event occurs. {% data reusables.developer-site.multiple_activity_types %} For information about the REST API, see "[Check suites](/rest/reference/checks#suites)."

{% data reusables.github-actions.branch-requirement %}

{% note %}

**Note:** To prevent recursive workflows, this event does not trigger workflows if the check suite was created by {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}.

{% endnote %}

| Webhook event payload | Activity types | `GITHUB_SHA` | `GITHUB_REF` |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------|
| [`check_suite`](/webhooks/event-payloads/#check_suite) | - `completed`<br/>- `requested`<br/>- `rerequested`<br/> | Last commit on default branch | Default branch |

{% data reusables.developer-site.limit_workflow_to_activity_types %}

For example, you can run a workflow when a check suite has been `rerequested` or `completed`.

```yaml
onexample, you can run a workflow when a pull request has been `assigned`, `opened`, `synchronize`, or `reopened`.

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [assigned, opened, synchronize, reopened]
```

{% data reusables.developer-site.pull_request_forked_repos_link %}

### `pull_request_review`

Runs your workflow anytime the `pull_request_review` event occurs. {% data reusables.developer-site.multiple_activity_types %} For information about the REST API, see "[Pull request reviews](/rest/reference/pulls#reviews)."

| Webhook event payload | Activity types | `GITHUB_SHA` | `GITHUB_REF` |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------|
| [`pull_request_review`](/webhooks/event-payloads/#pull_request_review) | - `submitted`<br/>- `edited`<br/>- `dismissed` | Last merge commit on the `GITHUB_REF` branch | PR merge branch `refs/pull/:prNumber/merge` |

{% data reusables.developer-site.limit_workflow_to_activity_types %}

For example, you can run a workflow when a pull request review has been `edited` or `dismissed`.

```yaml
on:
  pull_request_review:
    types: [edited, dismissed]
```

{% data reusables.developer-site.pull_request_forked_repos_link %}

### `pull_request_review_comment`

Runs your workflow anytime a comment on a pull request's unified diff is modified, which triggers the `pull_request_review_comment` event. {% data reusables.developer-site.multiple_activity_types %} For information about the REST API, see [Review comments](/rest/reference/pulls#comments).

| Webhook event payload | Activity types | `GITHUB_SHA` | `GITHUB_REF` |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------|
| [`pull_request_review_comment`](/webhooks/event-payloads/#pull_request_review_comment) | - `created`<br/>- `edited`<br/>- `deleted`| Last merge commit on the `GITHUB_REF` branch | PR merge branch `refs/pull/:prNumber/merge` |

{% data reusables.developer-site.limit_workflow_to_activity_types %}

For example, you can run a workflow when a pull request review comment has been `created` or `deleted`.

```yaml
on:
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created, deleted]
```

{% data reusables.developer-site.pull_request_forked_repos_link %}

### `pull_request_target`

This event runs in the context of the base of the pull request, rather than in the merge commit as the `pull_request` event does.  This prevents executing unsafe workflow code from the head of the pull request that could alter your repository or steal any secrets you use in your workflow. This event allows you to do things like create workflows that label and comment on pull requests based on the contents of the event payload.

{% warning %}

**Warning:** The `pull_request_target` event is granted a read/write repository token and can access secrets, even when it is triggered from a fork. Although the workflow runs in the context of the base of the pull request, you should make sure that you do not check out, build, or run untrusted code from the pull request with this event. Additionally, any caches share the same scope as the base branch, and to help prevent cache poisoning, you should not save the cache if there is a possibility that the cache contents were altered. For more information, see "[Keeping your GitHub Actions and workflows secure: Preventing pwn requests](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests)" on the GitHub Security Lab website.

{% endwarning %}

| Webhook event payload | Activity types | `GITHUB_SHA` | `GITHUB_REF` |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------|
| [`pull_request_target`](/webhooks/event-payloads/#pull_request) | - `assigned`<br/>- `unassigned`<br/>- `labeled`<br/>- `unlabeled`<br/>- `opened`<br/>- `edited`<br/>- `closed`<br/>- `reopened`<br/>- `synchronize`<br/>- `converted_to_draft`<br/>- `ready_for_review`<br/>- `locked`<br/>- `unlocked` <br/>- `review_requested` <br/>- `review_request_removed`{% ifversion fpt or ghes > 3.0 or ghae or ghec %} <br/>- `auto_merge_enabled` <br/>- `auto_merge_disabled`{% endif %} | Last commit on the PR base branch | PR base branch |

By default, a workflow only runs when a `pull_request_target`'s activity type is `opened`, `synchronize`, or `reopened`. To trigger workflows for more activity types, use the `types` keyword. For more information, see "[Workflow syntax for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}](/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onevent_nametypes)."

For example, you can run a workflow when a pull request has been `assigned`, `opened`, `synchronize`, or `reopened`.

```yaml
on:
  pull_request_target:
    types: [assigned, opened, synchronize, reopened]
```

### `push`

{% note %}

**Note:** The webhook payload available to GitHub Actions does not include the `added`, `removed`, and `modified` attributes in the `commit` object. You can retrieve the full commit object using the REST API. For more information, see "[Get a commit](/rest/reference/repos#get-a-commit)".

{% endnote %}

Runs your workflow when someone pushes to a repository branch, which triggers the `push` event.

| Webhook event payload | Activity types | `GITHUB_SHA` | `GITHUB_REF` |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------|
| [`push`](/webhooks/event-payloads/#push) | n/a | Commit pushed, unless deleting a branch (when it's the default branch) | Updated ref |

For example, you can run a workflow when the `push` event occurs.

```yaml
on:
  push
```

### `registry_package`

Runs your workflow anytime a package is `published` or `updated`. For more information, see "[Managing packages with {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}](/github/managing-packages-with-github-packages)."

| Webhook event payload | Activity types | `GITHUB_SHA` | `GITHUB_REF` |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------|
| [`registry_package`](/webhooks/event-payloads/#package) | - `published`<br/>- `updated` | Commit of the published package | Branch or tag of the published package |

{% data reusables.developer-site.limit_workflow_to_activity_types %}

For example, you can run a workflow when a package has been `published`.

```yaml
on:
  registry_package:
    types: [published]
```

### `release`

{% note %}

**Note:** The `release` event is not triggered for draft releases.

{% endnote %}

Runs your workflow anytime the `release` event occurs. {% data reusables.developer-site.multiple_activity_types %} For information about the REST API, see "[Releases](/rest/reference/repos#releases)."

| Webhook event payload | Activity types | `GITHUB_SHA` | `GITHUB_REF` |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------|
| [`release`](/webhooks/event-payloads/#release) | - `published` <br/>- `unpublished` <br/>- `created` <br/>- `edited` <br/>- `deleted` <br/>- `prereleased`<br/> - `released` | Last commit in the tagged release | Tag of release |

{% data reusables.developer-site.limit_workflow_to_activity_types %}

For example, you can run a workflow when a release has been `published`.

```yaml
on:
  release:
    types: [published]
```

{% note %}

**Note:** The `prereleased` type will not trigger for pre-releases published from draft releases, but the `published` type will trigger. If you want a workflow to run when stable *and* pre-releases publish, subscribe to `published` instead of `released` and `prereleased`.

{% endnote %}

### `status`

Runs your workflow anytime the status of a Git commit changes, which triggers the `status` event. For information about the REST API, see [Statuses](/rest/reference/repos#statuses).

{% data reusables.github-actions.branch-requirement %}

| Webhook event payload | Activity types | `GITHUB_SHA` | `GITHUB_REF` |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------|
| [`status`](/webhooks/event-payloads/#status) | n/a | Last commit on default branch | n/a |

For example, you can run a workflow when the `status` event occurs.

```yaml
on:
  status
```

### `watch`

Runs your workflow anytime the `watch` event occurs. {% data reusables.developer-site.multiple_activity_types %} For information about the REST API, see "[Starring](/rest/reference/activity#starring)."

{% data reusables.github-actions.branch-requirement %}

| Webhook event payload | Activity types | `GITHUB_SHA` | `GITHUB_REF` |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------|
| [`watch`](/webhooks/event-payloads/#watch) | - `started` | Last commit on default branch | Default branch |

{% data reusables.developer-site.limit_workflow_to_activity_types %}

For example, you can run a workflow when someone stars a repository, which is the `started` activity type that triggers the watch event.

```yaml
on:
  watch:
    types: [started]
```

### `workflow_run`

{% data reusables.webhooks.workflow_run_desc %}

{% note %}

**Notes:** 

* This event will only trigger a workflow run if the workflow file is on the default branch.

* You can't use `workflow_run` to chain together more than three levels of workflows. For example, if you attempt to trigger five workflows (named `B` to `F`) to run sequentially after an initial workflow `A` has run (that is: `A` ‚Üí `B` ‚Üí `C` ‚Üí `D` ‚Üí `E` ‚Üí `F`), workflows `E` and `F` will not be run.

{% endnote %}

| Webhook event payload | Activity types | `GITHUB_SHA` | `GITHUB_REF` |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------|
| [`workflow_run`](/webhooks/event-payloads/#workflow_run) | - `completed`<br/>- `requested` | Last commit on default branch | Default branch |

{% data reusables.developer-site.limit_workflow_to_activity_types %}

If you need to filter branches from this event, you can use `branches` or `branches-ignore`.

In this example, a workflow is configured to run after the separate "Run Tests" workflow completes.

```yaml
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["Run Tests"]
    branches: [main]
    types:
      - completed

To run a workflow job conditionally based on the result of the previous workflow run, you can use the [`jobs.<job_id>.if`](/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idif) or [`jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].if`](/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsif) conditional combined with the `conclusion` of the previous run. For example:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["Build"]
    types: [completed]

jobs:
  on-success:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: {% raw %}${{ github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success' }}{% endraw %}
    steps:
      ...
  on-failure:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: {% raw %}${{ github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'failure' }}{% endraw %}
    steps:
      ...
```

## Triggering new workflows using a personal access token

{% data reusables.github-actions.actions-do-not-trigger-workflows %} For more information, see "[Authenticating with the GITHUB_TOKEN](/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token)."

If you would like to trigger a workflow from a workflow run, you can trigger the event using a personal access token. You'll need to create a personal access token and store it as a secret. To minimize your {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} usage costs, ensure that you don't create recursive or unintended workflow runs. For more information on storing a personal access token as a secret, see "[Creating and storing encrypted secrets](/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets)."
